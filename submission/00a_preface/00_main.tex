\textbf{ROUGH DRAFT (JUST THE ABSTRACT FROM MY JOB TALK FOR NOW)}

~

\hspace{-15pt}Drone cameras are now being deployed in a wide range of applications, including Hollywood filmmaking, search and rescue, wildlife monitoring, and large-scale 3D scanning.
However, drones remain difficult to control, both for humans and for computers.
In this talk, I will present a variety of trajectory optimization methods that make it easier for people to use drone cameras.
I will focus specifically on two different applications, cinematography and 3D scanning.
First, I will present an interactive tool for designing drone camera shots, focusing on the key insights and trajectory optimization algorithms that inform its design.
I will show examples of ambitious aerial cinematography that have been created using this tool, by users with absolutely no experience flying drones.
Second, I will present an end-to-end drone camera system for high-quality aerial 3D scanning.
I will focus on the trajectory optimization algorithms that power the system, and I will demonstrate that these algorithms enable the system to reconstruct large real-world scenes with unprecedented accuracy.
