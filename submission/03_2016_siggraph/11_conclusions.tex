\section{Conclusions}

We analyzed the dynamics of a quadrotor along a fixed path, and we found that the quadrotor's velocities and control forces are fully determined by its progress curve along the path.
This insight lead us to a fast and user-friendly algorithm for generating feasible quadrotor camera trajectories.
We implemented our algorithm in an open source tool for designing quadrotor camera shots, and we ran performance benchmarks on a dataset of infeasible quadrotor camera trajectories.
We found that our approach is between 25$\times$ and 180$\times$ faster than spacetime constraints.
We successfully captured real video footage using the trajectories generated by our algorithm.

In the future, we believe the ideas in this paper could become part of the standard toolbox for quadrotor trajectory planning.
By moving along networks of fixed paths, quadrotor cameras could film highly dynamic scenes with stronger safety guarantees.
By considering other objective functions along fixed paths, quadrotors could perform a wide range of tasks more efficiently and more safely.
